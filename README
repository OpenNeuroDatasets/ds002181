These are the EEG baseline data used in the study on the association between stunting and EEG brain functional connectivity in Bangladeshi children (https://doi.org/10.1101/447722).

Data with an ID <  2000 were collected for a cohort of  36-month-old toddlers, and those with an ID > 2000 were collected for a cohort of 6-month-old infants.  The children were watching screen savers for 2 minutes.
